# Kubernetes Admission Controller for Black Duck in Artifactory

This repository contains a small HTTP server that can be used as a Kubernetes
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook-beta-in-19).

The logic of this demo webhook is fairly simple: it enforces more secure defaults for running
containers if a Black Duck policy violation is present in an artifactory image. It's possible to run an artifactory image
only if it's not in a Black Duck policy violation.

## Prerequisites

A cluster on which this example can be tested must be running Kubernetes 1.9.0 or above,
with the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API enabled. You can verify that by observing that the
following command produces a non-empty output:

```
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```

In addition, the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controller should be added and listed in the admission-control
flag of `kube-apiserver`.

For building the image, [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Go](https://golang.org) are required.

## Deploying the Artifactory Webhook Server

1. Bring up a Kubernetes cluster satisfying the above prerequisites, and make
sure it is active (i.e., either via the configuration in the default location, or by setting
the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable).

2. Change the artifactory credentials in `cmd/webhook-server/main.go` to your own. (Don't commit it)

3. Change the docker image "gautambaghel/art-ac:latest" in `auto.sh` with your own docker username and image name

4. Use the docker username and image in the `deployment/deployment.yaml.template` file and replace "gautambaghel/art-ac:latest"

5. Run `./auto.sh`. This will create a new go binary based on Artifactory Creds and deploy it to the image mentioned in the steps aboev it will also create a CA, a certificate and private key for the webhook server,
and deploy the resources in the newly created `webhook-demo` namespace in your Kubernetes cluster.


## Verify

1. The `webhook-server` pod in the `webhook-demo` namespace should be running:

```
$ kubectl -n webhook-demo get pods
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webhook-server-6f976f7bf-hssc9   1/1       Running   0          35m
```

2. A `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` named `demo-webhook` should exist:

```
$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations
NAME           AGE
demo-webhook   36m
```

3. Deploy [a pod](examples/pod-with-defaults.yaml) that is in your artifactory instance with either blackduck.overallStatus not set or set to "NOT_IN_VIOLATION":

```
$ kubectl create -f examples/pod-with-defaults.yaml
$ pod/pod-with-defaults created
```

4. Attempt to deploy [a pod](examples/pod-with-conflict.yaml) that is in your artifactory instance with blackduck.overallStatus set to "IN_VIOLATION":

```
$ kubectl create -f examples/pod-with-conflict.yaml

Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "pod-with-conflicts.yaml": Internal error occurred: admission webhook "webhook-server.webhook-demo.svc" denied the request: AC webhook: Black Duck policy violation for the image <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_VERSION>

```

## Build the Image from Sources (optional)

An image can be built by running `make`.
If you want to modify the webhook server for testing purposes, be sure to set and export
the shell environment variable `IMAGE` to an image tag for which you have push access. You can then
build and push the image by running `make push-image`. Also make sure to change the image tag
in `deployment/deployment.yaml.template`, and if necessary, add image pull secrets.
